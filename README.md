## Hello there ðŸ‘‹, I'm RaÃºl

Let me introduce myself a little:

# About me
I'm a 24-year-old developer, why I decided to become a developer? I still don't know why I want to suffer so much but, surely I'll get the point someday.

Jokes apart... I decided to become a developer to help people get their ideas running efficiently and also help them with their business growth using the latest technologies in the market, meaning that I'm always learning new technologies.

Nowadays I'm currently working as a web developer for Smart Baby SLU and Tecno Baby SL, both companies based in Barcelona, Spain. I've been working for them for the past 3 years and a half since I got my middle degree. Also, I'm studying a Web Developer Degree in Mallorca, at a specialised centre called Es Liceu and based in MarratxÃ­, Spain.

For my free time, I normally search for costumers and read comics/books or play videogames. Being a Star Wars hardcore fan nowadays is a quite challenging life.
